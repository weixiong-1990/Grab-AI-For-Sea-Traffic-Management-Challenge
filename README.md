# Grab-AI-For-Sea-Traffic-Management-Challenge
This repository includes the training set and the solution in Jupyter notebook of the **Grab AI for SEA - Traffice Mangement Challenge** (website: https://www.aiforsea.com/traffic-management).

In the Jupyter notebook, Random Forest and XGBoost are compared and a model is built to predict travel demand based on historical Grab booking information including locations and time.
